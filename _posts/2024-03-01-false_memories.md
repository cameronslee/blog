```
false memory
an apparent recollection of an event that did not actually occur 
```

Something that I pondered recently about false memories is that they mirror the
following paradigm:

```
Hallucination (artificial intelligence)
A confident response that seems unjustified by the training data
```

Our actions become mere decisons based off of input bias.

In that case, our **memories** are prone to bias from the objective reality 
that we live in.

**We create memories to either build the best versions of ourseleves or hide the worst.**

```
// load inputs from the dataset
inputs = [
    "trauma",
    "trauma2",
    "trauma3",
    "trauma4",
    "trauma5",
    "trauma6",
    ...
    ]

load_data(inputs)

// show up EVERYDAY regardless of state
state = stable ? "stable" : "stable"
print(state)
```

We scramble to put the picture together. 

*quickly!*

We need to have something to show them.

**client: "excellent, what is the training error?"**

This text delves into the concept of false memories and their relationship to biases in our recollection processes. It draws an analogy between false memories and the phenomenon of confident responses in artificial intelligence that lack substantial training data support. The narrative suggests that our memories are influenced by the biases inherent in our perception of reality, shaping them to either enhance our self-image or conceal negative aspects. Trauma is highlighted as a significant factor contributing to memory distortion, leading individuals to reconstruct their experiences. The text concludes by alluding to the necessity of presenting a coherent narrative to others, hinting at the complexity of memory formation and recall.

The mention of "training error" at the end could be interpreted as questioning the reliability of memory formation and retrieval processes, hinting at potential flaws or inaccuracies in how memories are stored and recalled based on individual biases and external influences.
